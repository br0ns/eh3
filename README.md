# Elektronhjerne 3

This was a hobby project a while back.  I wanted to port the NeatCC compiler to
a different architecture, so I made one (EH3) for that purpose.

Continuing this project would have no real purpose, and so I'm dumping it here
on the Interwebz, in case anyone finds it interesting.

Several git repositories are included, but not as submodules, because I'm lazy.
Those will have a file called `ORIGIN` in their root with the URL of the
repository on GitHub.

## Requirements

Loads.  But everything is 32 bits, so you need at least `libc6-dev:i386` (on
Debian).
